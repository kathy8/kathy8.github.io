Today was all about Jumping into Arrays in Ruby. It was getting the family to finally work together as a group. 
Arrays store pieces of data in a collection and retrieves a certain element by referring to it's position. 
They can contain all kinds of things such as strings, intergers, hashes, etc. 
It is best practice to stay with one element at a time. 

A defined variable with [] is the proper syntax.
I discovered new gateways of behavior such as the shovel method, .push, .unshift, .pop and .shift. 
These methods give the elements in a program the ability of movement with organization. 

Completing the tic tac toe lab you were able to practice and experience how beneficial they are to coding. 

Can't wait to see what next !!!
