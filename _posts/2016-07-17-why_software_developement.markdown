"#Why Software Developement?" Owning my own motel and fifties diner in upsate New York is where my passion for software development began.In my desparate search to find someone to create a website for my business, I began researching and teaching myself the basics of html and css. I was able to make a website that had online reservations, a blog and store. I had the ability to update or change the site whenever needed. This was extremely important with running a seasonal business on a shoestring budget.

After moving across the country I continued my career in the hospitality and restaurant industry. I realized that after being in this role for serveral years, what I missed the most was the time I spent working on web deveopment. Testing the site, solving user challenges, renovating and applying new ideas is what personally excited me.

Reinventing my career in software development has always been my true calling. Expanding my skills in the tech industry has opened the door to extraordinary opportunities. Why? The act of being a part of something bigger from conception to it's final manifestion. Developers work through challenges, create, shape and apply ideas that not only change ourselves but everything around us. It has alllowed me the freedom to connect with others in a variety of platforms with unlimited personal and professional growth.
