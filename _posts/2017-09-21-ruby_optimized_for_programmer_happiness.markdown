I am admitting that learning the Ruby language has been challenging. We are learning about all these tools and spending a ton of time on the command line learning how to use them but I am a visual learner. I need to see how these applications are changing programs and sites. I am constanly questioning what can these tools do in various applications? 
What can they build? How do these tools function? What does it look like on an application built with Ruby? 
I need to visually see how it will all come together. 

Well I went on a little search and found some amazing sites built on Ruby and wanted to share. This definetly keeps my motivation up. Here are a few of the many sites I found : 

1. Github
2. Basecamp
3. Airbnb
4. Twitch
5. Shopify
6. Cookpad
7. Zendesk

Then I bumped into the Ruby on Rails doctrine [(http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/)]
I think this is a valuable resource to help us visualize the great things we can accomplish.
